About the Project
-----------------

**ByByte.DIY** is an open educational project aimed at teaching school-age children and students robotics and programming through practical tasks.

The foundation of the project consists of:

**🤖 Robotic Platforms**

Two levels of complexity for different skill levels:

* **ByByte nano** - Simple platform for beginners and home learning
  
  * Easy to assemble without professional skills
  * No special equipment required
  * Uses common, affordable components
  * Perfect for individual learning at home

* **ByByte Mega** - Advanced platform with maximum peripherals
  
  * Professional-grade robotics platform
  * Full set of sensors and modules
  * Ideal for schools and educational institutions
  * Great for robotics clubs and workshops

**📚 Educational Curriculum**

* Structured lessons designed by robotics teachers and IT professionals
* Different difficulty levels for various skill levels
* Practical, hands-on approach to learning
* All new lessons reviewed and approved by moderators

**🎯 STEM Approach**

Our methodology: **Practice First, Theory Second**

1. **Build** - Assemble your robot (hands-on practice)
2. **Program** - Learn theory through practical programming
3. **Experiment** - Develop problem-solving skills

Project Goals
-------------

Our mission is to **collectively build a high-quality platform** for learning programming, electronics, and robotics suitable for:

✅ **Schools** - Complete curriculum for classroom teaching

✅ **Robotics Clubs** - Ready-made lessons and projects

✅ **Educational Institutions** - Professional platform with full documentation

✅ **Home Learning** - Anyone can learn independently by building the simplest version

.. important::
   **All information, instructions, and components needed to build both platforms are available in our repositories and this guide!**
